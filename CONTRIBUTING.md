# Contributing to RiveAnimatedIcon
Thank you for taking out time to contribute!üéâ

## Guildlines for making contribution‚¨áÔ∏è‚Äã
We are currently updating our rive animated icon library and adding new icons, if you'd like to add icons you have animated in rive, do note the following:
- If you are adding new icons animated in rive, ensure that icon assets are imported into Rive not designed in Rive, also ensure that you don't add any additional design to the icon in Rive.
  This is because at the moment Rive doesn't provide a dedicated API for changing asset color from code, with this we can ensure that the color of the icon is fully adjustable from your code.
  
- Make sure to remove unused artboards from your .riv file, so that the file size is minimal
  
- If you're animating a set of icons in rive, use nested artboards to add all the icons to one artboard and to one file. This helps to get things well organized.
  
- When creating a pr if you would be adding new icons, also add the .rev file of your animation so that, it can be reviewed as well.
